# APODweekpics
show the basic description of images from the last week for NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day

Student Project, CISC 3160 lab 1, call an API and neatly print it's data.  Shows Title, explanation, concept, HQ URL and HQ URL for only images from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.  currently only prints to console but could be easily adapted to send an email for low bandwidth users once a week or printed to a basic website.  

leaves the DEMO_KEY for the API call with the expectation a real key is to be used for actual requests.

A sample input JSON and output from it are included.
